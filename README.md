Dynamic Spaceships: Two unique spaceships for each player (yellow and red).
Obstacles: Meteors moving across the screen in random directions, adding an extra layer of difficulty.
Sound Effects: Bullet fire and hit sounds enhance the gameplay experience.
Health System: Each spaceship has a health bar that decreases when hit by bullets or collides with meteors.
Background and Visuals: Engaging space-themed background and well-designed spaceship and meteor images.
